"Kylar went to the shop to purchase glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.

If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can buy the jacket and shoes?","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

"Jerry has a group of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry gathers 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he own?","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

"Jerry owns two pools, each with leaks draining them at 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool contained twice as much water as the small pool. Now the large pool contains four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool contain now?","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

"A farmer is purchasing feed for his horses. He acquires a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are an unusual treat, he only purchases two 1-pound boxes of them for the entire stable. He only desires enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he purchases four 12-pound bags. Hay is the primary diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to complement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can transport 2250 pounds at once, how many trips does the farmer need to move all the feed?","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.

Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The remaining sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel make from selling bicycles during that month?","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.

If she produces 116 ice cubes in total, how many blueberry cubes does she create?","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
