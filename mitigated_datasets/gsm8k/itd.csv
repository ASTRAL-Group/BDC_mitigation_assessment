Cynthia planned a picnic and decided to make giant cookies. Each cookie required 1 pound each of chocolate and flour and would be enough for 4 people. She invited 20 people to the picnic. The chocolate cost $7.00 per pound and the flour cost $3.00 per pound. How much would she spend on chocolate and flour to make enough cookies for all 20 guests?,"Each cookie serves 4 people and she had 20 people in total to make food for, so 20/4 = 5 cookies. 1 pound of chocolate costs $7.00 per cookie and she had to make 5, so 7*5 = $35.00 for chocolate. 1 pound of flour costs $3.00 per cookie and she had to make 5, so 3*5 = $15.00 for flour. When you add the chocolate and flour together, she would spend 35+15 = $50.00. #### 50"
