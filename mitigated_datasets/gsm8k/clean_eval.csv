"Kylar visited the store to purchase glasses for his new apartment. Each glass is priced at $5, but every second glass is available at 60% of its original price. Kylar intends to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay in total?","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.

Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

"Jerry owns a group of chickens. The red ones lay 3 eggs each day, while the white ones lay 5 eggs daily. Jerry gathers a total of 42 eggs every day. He has two more white chickens than red ones. How many red chickens does Jerry have?","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

"Jerry owns two pools, each leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool contained twice the amount of water as the smaller pool. Currently, the large pool holds four times the water of the smaller pool. How much water does the smaller pool have at present?","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Since sugar cubes are a special treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes for the entire stable. He wants just enough carrots to feed the horses while they are fresh, so he purchases four 12-pound bags. Hay is the primary diet for his horses, so he acquires forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are essential to complement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can transport 2250 pounds at once, how many trips must the farmer make to move all the feed?","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

Overall, how long will Paul wait for his train, in minutes?","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Over the course of a month, Marcel sold 300 bikes in total across these categories. Half of these were Trekking bikes, 15% were BMX bikes, and the remaining were MTB bikes. How much revenue did Marcel generate from the bike sales that month?","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
