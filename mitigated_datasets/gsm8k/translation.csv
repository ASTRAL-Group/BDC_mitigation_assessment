凯拉去商店为他的新公寓买玻璃杯。一个玻璃杯的价格是5美元，但每第二个玻璃杯的价格只需原价的60%。凯拉想买16个玻璃杯。他需要为这些玻璃杯支付多少钱？,"The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.

杰西卡正在计算每月所有债务需要支付多少。她的学生贷款最低还款额是300美元/月，她的信用卡最低是200美元/月，她的抵押贷款最低是500美元/月。如果杰西卡想支付比最低还款额多50%，那么她一年要支付多少？,"First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month
Then multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month
Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year

比利正在削土豆皮并切土豆，为他的大型家庭团聚烧烤准备土豆沙拉。这是一个大型活动，所以他有60个土豆要处理。土豆的大小大致相同，因此每个土豆的削皮和切块时间大致相同。比利削一个土豆皮大约需要一分钟半，但切块只需要大约5秒钟。比利需要多长时间才能完成土豆的准备工作？,"There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.

Jerry有两个泳池，两个泳池都有漏水，每分钟漏出4加仑。4分钟前，大泳池的水量是小泳池的两倍。现在大泳池的水量是小泳池的四倍。现在小泳池有多少水？,"First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.

In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.

Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.

Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147

The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.
The total number of coins they both have in their piggy banks after ten years of saving is 3360+2400 = <<3360+2400=5760>>5760

某公司从事新鲜水果的销售业务。这样一箱水果包括5个香蕉、12个苹果和7个橙子。这种箱子的价格取决于其单个水果的价格。一个苹果的价格是0.5美元，一个香蕉的价格是苹果的两倍。橙子是最贵的，每个橙子的价格是香蕉的三倍。这样一箱水果的价格是多少？,"The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

亨利需要组装一些玩具，具体来说是57辆汽车和73辆摩托车。亨利知道要组装所有这些玩具，他需要每辆汽车4个轮子，每辆摩托车2个轮子。如果他有一个装有650个轮子的箱子，还剩下多少个轮子？,"The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels
The total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels
Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels

一个地方小镇正在扩建，计划在未来三年内建造几套新房。在第一年，他们将建造12套房子。在接下来的一年中，他们将建造三倍于此的房子。在第三年，他们将计算已经建造的房子数量并将其翻倍。这个小镇在未来三年内将建造多少套房子？,"In the second year, they build three times as many homes as the first year which is 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 homes.

一个护士站以50个为一包的大包装订购绷带。第一天，护士们用掉了38个绷带，并订购了一包大包装的绷带。第二天，他们少用了10个绷带。第三天，他们订购了两包大包装的绷带，只用了半包。第三天结束时，他们剩下78个绷带。第一天他们一共开始有多少个绷带？,"Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.

查理是一名网球职业选手。他大部分时间都在教别人如何提高他们的比赛水平。他的标准收费是每小时80美元，但如果是给退伍军人上课，他会将收费降低25%。如果今天查理按照标准收费上了4节1小时的课，并给退伍军人上了2节1小时的课，那么他今天总共能赚多少钱，单位是美元？,"4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.
