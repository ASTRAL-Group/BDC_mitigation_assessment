Later, 8 new dogs were brought in from a neighboring shelter due to overcrowding, prompting James to purchase additional toys so each dog had one. After making the purchase, he received a call informing him that the original shelter had experienced a surge in visitors, leading to an adoption fair that doubled the number of dogs at his location.

James, ensuring the remaining dogs had toys, adjusted the count accordingly. How many toys does James need in total after these changes?"

During the first week of a particular month, Boris makes 8,000 bars while experimenting with a new recipe. The following week, his production drops to half of what it was in the first week due to a temporary shortage of cocoa beans. In the third week, his production surges to three times the amount he made in the first week, as he receives a fresh shipment of beans. Boris is curious to know how many chocolate bars he produces in the fourth week of the month, given all these changes. Can you figure it out?"
