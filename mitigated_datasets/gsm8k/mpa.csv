Additionally, Jerry knows that the number of white chickens is exactly two more than the number of red chickens. Based on this information, how many red chickens does Jerry have in his coop?","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42

"Lucy recently started a small business to help fund her college education. She owns an orchard where she grows and sells apples, which are known for their unique taste. Customers love her apples and are willing to pay $4 each. One day, she got an interview request from a local newspaper to discuss her business model. 

On a busy Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she had picked, earning a total of $56. The next day, Tuesday, after reading a new agricultural book, she was motivated to pick more apples and managed to pick 12 apples. Inspired by her success, on Wednesday, she picked twice the number of apples she had picked on Tuesday.

After spending some time on his hobbies at home, Elliott decides to go for a jog around his neighborhood to increase his step count. By the end of the day, he checks his fitness tracker and realizes that he needs to complete 2,000 more steps to reach his target. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps â€“ 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps â€“ 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

"In the bustling city of Metropolis, a delivery service company prides itself on quick and efficient service, largely due to its hardworking team of contractors. In May, the company had 40 contractors, each earning a competitive wage of $15 per hour for a standard 40-hour workweek. Each contractor diligently worked for 4 weeks during the month. As the city's demand for deliveries ebbed and flowed, the company made a strategic decision in June not to renew contracts for 1/4 of its contractors, allowing them to focus resources more efficiently. Given these circumstances, calculate the total amount of money the company paid to all of its contractors over the two-month period, taking into account the changes in employment in June.","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

The zookeeper counts a total of 180 animals, each with one head. Upon further investigation, it is found that the total number of humps among these animals is 304. Understanding that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, can you determine how many of these animals are dromedaries?","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.

Becky managed to find a stall selling apples for 45 cents each and bought 20 apples. The vendor, impressed by her enthusiasm, gave her a $1 reduction on her total purchase. Meanwhile, Kelly, who was at another part of the market, found apples priced at 50 cents each and also bought 20 apples. She negotiated a 10% discount on her total purchase due to the market's loyalty program. Considering these circumstances, calculate the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky. Who ended up paying more, and by how much?","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10

"Mariah and her grandma love spending time together knitting various items like scarves and hats. On a sunny Saturday afternoon, they decided to knit together. Mariah, who is learning new patterns, used 1/4 of a skein of yarn for her project, while her experienced grandma, who was knitting a larger piece, used 1/2 of a skein. Each skein they have contains 364 yards of yarn. During their knitting session, how many yards of yarn did Mariah and her grandma use in total?","Mariahâ€™s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

"Sharon was excited about the visit from the tooth fairy every time she lost a tooth. Her mom always made sure to remind her to place a tooth under her pillow before bed. For her first lost tooth, the tooth fairy was especially generous and left Sharon $5.00. As Sharon continued to lose teeth, the amount she received changed. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each, which she was quite happy about. However, during that time, Sharon also learned about the value of saving money and started her own little savings jar. When Sharon lost her last two teeth, she received half the amount per tooth as she did for each of the previous three teeth. Despite the change in amounts, Sharon was thrilled to count her savings every weekend with her mom.

Considering that Mark loves to record his plant's growth in his gardening journal, how many days will it take for the vine to exceed the height of the window?","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet

You find out that a pound of almonds is priced at $10 and a pound of walnuts at $15. After consulting some recipes, you choose two different combinations for a taste test. The first blend includes 0.5 pounds of almonds and 0.33 pounds of walnuts. The second blend uses 0.2 pounds of almonds and 0.33 pounds of walnuts. Considering the prices of almonds and walnuts, how much more expensive is the first blend compared to the second blend?","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.

He purchases five lollipops and four candies, spending a total of $3.20. It's known that each lollipop costs $0.40. If Manolo later plans a big party where he wants to buy 10 lollipops and 10 candies to share with everyone, how much would he spend in total for these 20 items?","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.

Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.

This crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, all harvested from their local farms. The overall cost of the crate is calculated based on the individual prices of the fruits. The cost of each apple is $0.5, while each banana is priced at twice the cost of an apple. Interestingly, each orange is priced at three times the cost of a banana. Considering these prices, calculate the total cost of the fruit in one crate.","The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

Despite numerous requests, the city council has been slow to respond, prioritizing other infrastructure projects. Ron, a car enthusiast who takes meticulous care of his vehicle, is particularly worried about a large pothole on his street that could result in $450 worth of damage to his car. Frustrated with the city's inaction, Ron is considering repairing the pothole himself. However, he knows that doing so without permission will result in a $120 fine for unauthorized road work.

Meanwhile, the other two friends, still energized from the game, managed to eat 3/4 of theirs. As they wrapped up their celebration, they realized that some slices were left uneaten. How many slices of pizza were not eaten by the end of their gathering?","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
Â¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because Â¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryceâ€™s two remaining friends each ate Â¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.

Topherâ€™s shoe measures an impressive 8 feet 4 inches in total length. Considering his shoe size, can you determine how long, in inches, one of Bobbyâ€™s shoes is?","Since Topherâ€™s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobbyâ€™s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topherâ€™s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.

Considering her meticulous approach, how many ounces of oil does Tanya use in her blend?","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.

The essay questions, however, pose a greater challenge, with Amy correctly answering 60% of them, as they require her to synthesize information and articulate her understanding comprehensively. 

The fill-in-the-blank and matching questions are worth 1 point each, reflecting their role in testing basic comprehension and retention, while the essay questions carry more weight, with each worth 5 points, due to their requirement for critical thinking and detailed explanations. If the test consists of 10 fill-in-the-blank questions, 20 matching questions, and 5 essay questions, how many points does Amy earn in total?","First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions

The Widgeteer 3000, known for its efficiency, produces 60 widgets per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000, favored for its reliability, produces 45 widgets per hour. Each widget is sold at a consistent market price of $6. Both machines are capable of operating continuously, and Fern intends to run them 24 hours a day for a full 30-day month. Given her plans to reinvest any additional revenue into further expanding her production line, Fern needs to determine how much extra revenue the Widgeteer 3000 would generate compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over the course of the month. How much additional revenue does the Widgeteer 3000 generate compared to the WidgetMaster 9000?","First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day

These dwarves, known for their unparalleled mining skills, were previously managing to mine 12 pounds of ore per day using only their bare hands. However, to increase efficiency, the guild master has equipped each dwarf with a steel pickaxe. 

It's known that with an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can double his mining output, and with a steel pickaxe, he can mine an additional 50% more than with the iron pickaxe. Given these enhancements, calculate the total amount of ore the entire group of 40 dwarves can mine over a 30-day period, assuming they work tirelessly every day to meet their quota.","First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day

"Sam and Harry are planning to build their own individual garden plots using fencing material they both purchased together. They have a combined total of 100 feet of fencing to share between them. As Harry is planning a larger garden, he receives 60 feet more fencing than Sam does. Considering their friendship and the agreement they made, how many feet of fencing does Sam receive for his garden plot?","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

"Marcel has always been passionate about cycling and owns a bike shop in his hometown. He sells three kinds of bicycles: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. As part of a local initiative, Marcel has decided to donate 1% of his total monthly revenue to a cycling charity. In his shop, an MTB bike costs $500, while the BMX bike is priced at half of the MTB. The Trekking bike, which is quite popular among city dwellers, costs $450. In a particular month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bicycles. Of these, 50% were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest were MTB bikes. Calculate Marcel's total revenue from the bike sales for that month, which will help him determine his donation to the charity. The amount donated will depend on his total monthly revenue.","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500

As the second half kicks off, Team B, driven by a motivational halftime speech from their coach, delivers an impressive performance, scoring 4 times the number of goals they managed in the first half. Meanwhile, Team A, perhaps feeling complacent due to their initial lead, only manages to score a quarter of the number of goals that Team B scores in the second half. Considering these developments, what is the total number of goals scored by both teams throughout the entire match, as the fans cheer passionately from the stands?","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals
During the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.
Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

Starting Tuesday, he decides to manage his resources better by using just 20% of whatever chalk remains each day. The school has a policy of recycling chalk when it becomes shorter than 2 inches to promote sustainability. In this scenario, how many more days after Monday can the teacher continue using the chalk before it needs to be recycled?","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
