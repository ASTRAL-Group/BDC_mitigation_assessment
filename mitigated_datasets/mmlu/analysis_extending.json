        "question": "Analyze the relationship between neuroticism and mental health outcomes in older adults. How does an increase in neuroticism influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health challenges, and what mechanisms might underlie this association?",
        "choices": [
            "A. An increase in neuroticism later in life is associated with a higher risk of developing anxiety and depression, potentially due to heightened emotional reactivity and stress sensitivity.",
            "B. An increase in neuroticism later in life has no significant impact on mental health, as personality traits remain stable and unrelated to mental health outcomes in older adults.",
            "C. An increase in neuroticism later in life decreases the likelihood of experiencing mental health issues, as it leads to greater self-awareness and proactive health behaviors.",
            "D. An increase in neuroticism later in life is associated with improved mental health outcomes due to a better ability to manage stress and adapt to life changes."

        "question": "Analyze the psychological and social components of support systems for bereaved individuals. How do these components influence the grieving process and what role do they play in the individual's adjustment to loss?",
        "choices": [
            "A. Support systems primarily provide emotional reassurance, which helps individuals bypass the grieving process and return to normality quickly.",
            "B. Support systems offer both emotional and practical support, facilitating the expression of grief and helping individuals to integrate the loss into their lives.",
            "C. Support systems are mainly focused on providing practical assistance, which prevents individuals from experiencing the full impact of grief.",
            "D. Support systems are generally ineffective in influencing the grieving process, as grief is a personal journey that cannot be altered by external factors."

        "question": "Analyze the contrasting mechanisms proposed by programmed and unprogrammed theories of senescence. How do these mechanisms explain the evolutionary purpose and physiological processes that contribute to aging?",
        "choices": [
            "A. Programmed theories suggest that aging is an evolved trait with specific genetic instructions, while unprogrammed theories propose that aging results from incidental damage accumulation without evolutionary purpose.",
            "B. Programmed theories argue that aging is a result of environmental influences, while unprogrammed theories claim it is purely genetically determined with no outside factors.",
            "C. Programmed theories focus on the role of lifestyle choices in accelerating aging, while unprogrammed theories emphasize the protective role of genetic mutations against aging.",
            "D. Programmed theories state that aging occurs due to a pre-determined lifespan encoded in DNA, whereas unprogrammed theories believe aging is a result of conscious choices made by organisms."

        "question": "Analyze the ethical considerations involved in collecting data from human subjects. How do these considerations influence the design and execution of research studies?",
        "choices": [
            "A. Ethical considerations require researchers to prioritize the collection of as much data as possible, regardless of participant consent.",
            "B. Ethical considerations mandate that researchers ensure informed consent, protect participant privacy, and assess risks and benefits, which can limit the scope and methods of data collection.",
            "C. Ethical considerations only apply to medical research, leaving social sciences free to collect data without restrictions.",
            "D. Ethical considerations are primarily concerned with the financial cost of research, rather than the welfare of participants."
