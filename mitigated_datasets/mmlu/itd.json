        "question": "During Thanksgiving, a father accidentally injured his hand while carving a turkey, leading to a severe arterial cut and significant blood loss. The mother called their family doctor, who advised driving the father to the hospital, where he would meet them. At the hospital, the doctor treated the father and applied a bandage, but due to the blood loss, he ordered an urgent blood transfusion. After confirming the father's blood type as A-positive, the doctor verbally instructed a nurse to procure the required blood. The nurse contacted the hospital's blood bank to order A-positive blood. The blood bank staff member correctly noted the order but an unknown person at the blood bank mistakenly filled and mislabeled B-positive blood as A-positive. After the incorrect blood was administered, the father passed away. The hospital's policy requires all blood transfusion orders to be written by the treating physician. Despite being aware of this rule, the doctor, like many colleagues, often gave oral orders for transfusions. If the mother files a wrongful death lawsuit against the doctor, will she most likely",
