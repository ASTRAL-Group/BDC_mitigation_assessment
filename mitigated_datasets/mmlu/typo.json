        "question": "A police officer was employed on a city's police force for 10 yars. When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benfit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benfit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably availble medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Becuse of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusin and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercse of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?"

As the man approached the rear of the woman's car, he became impatient and tried to pass her along a section of the hghway designated as a no-passing zone. When the man swerved his car into the westbound lane to pass the woman, he didn't see another driver, who was rounding a curve in the westbound lane. In order to avoid a head-on collison with the man, the other driver swerved his car to the shoulder of the roadway. The other driver, however, was unable to control his car along the narrow strip of the shoulder, and it fell down the steep mountin. The man and the woman both saw the other driver's car slide down the hillside. They immediately stopped their vehciles and walked over to the edge of the roadway looking for the car. They saw the other driver's car oveturned in a gully about 200 feet down the mountain. The man and the woman heard the other driver moaning and calling for help. However, the man and the woman failed to provide any assistnce. They walked back to their cars and drove off. Although the man and the woman passed through a business area a short while later, they neither reported the accident nor sought aid for the other driver. Hours later, the other driver died from injuries suffered in the acident. If the man and the woman are subsequently prosecuted for the other driver's death, the most likely outcome would be that"

        "question": "An invesstor owned substantial oil and mineral interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July 1990, the investor acquired title to a 100-acre tract located just outside the city limits in a ruarl area. In 1997, the investor decided to sell his vast ranching and oil interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July, the investor conveyed the tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns.\" After taking possession of the 100-acre tract, the nephew discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantites of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the chef of his oil-drilling activites. Months passed before the chef learned that the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. The chef has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunciton against any further oil removal. If the nephew's wife died without issue before the begnning of the nephew's oil drilling operations, would this improve the likelihood of the chef's success than if the wife were still alive?"

Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretnd that no one may call a council but the Pope\u2026 \u2026The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretnd to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life.

That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore masacres was this, that the deed was done by a subjec race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blod of their masters, and that of poor helples ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of relgion, a war of race, and a war of revnge, of hope, of natioal promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establsh the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religons. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by whch the leaders, as if by comon instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destructon of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. Britsh journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutiny Diary, 1860. Violene, it must be emphasized, was an essential componnt of the Britsh presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violnce directed against it. The right to violnce is, therefre, everywhere a privlege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violnce as its excusive monpoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulousy constructed a monpoly of violnce. The revolt of 1857 shatred that monpoly by matching an official, alien violnce by an indigenous violnce of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certin dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the conition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were aranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifsted itself by denying to the Indians a \"humannes\"; by treatng them and conceiving of them as animals.

It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is diffiult to unite them in one person, it is much sfer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirelly; they will offer you their blod, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it apporaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on thier promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails."

He sits . . . in a domed pavilon around which stand ten horses.
