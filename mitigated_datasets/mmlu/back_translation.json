The mother called their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor stated he would meet them there. Shortly afterward, at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the substantial blood loss, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A positive, the doctor verbally instructed the nurse employed by the hospital to obtain the blood needed for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and called the hospital's blood bank department to order a unit of A positive blood. The blood bank staff member who received the nurse's call correctly recorded the order for A positive blood. However, an unidentified worker at the blood bank made a mistake in processing the order and labeling the blood unit for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B positive blood incorrectly labeled as A positive. After the wrong blood was transfused, the father died. The hospital had a written policy requiring all transfusion orders to be made in writing by the doctor responsible for treating the patient.

The man's and the nephew's plots are in their undeveloped natural state. However, the son has lived in a house he built on his property for 10 years. In 2009, the man planted trees and shrubs on his land along the nephew's plot boundary. In 2010, the nephew, in order to build a house on his plot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep to build a basement. The excavation side near the man-nephew boundary suddenly collapsed, and part of the man's soil, trees, and shrubs fell into the pit. The nephew cleared away the debris.

The fee is $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50; Article 3: Permits will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis; however, after hearing from the applicant, the chief of police should deny any application if he believes that (a) the gathering would cause severe traffic congestion, or (b) interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or (c) the gathering speakers would incite criminal behavior.' A foreign exchange student plans to hold a demonstration in the city park. Although his previous protest gatherings attracted fewer than 25 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit under City Ordinance 172. After meeting with the student, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed this demonstration would incite the protesters and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. Subsequently, the student and his peers organized their gathering in the park. The gathering attracted only about 20 protesters and proceeded peacefully. As the student gave the final speech at the gathering, police arrived at the park and arrested the student and his peers, charging them with violating Ordinance 172.

Merchants and travelers could traverse the well-policed Mongol territories from Eastern Europe to southern China freely, without fear for their lives or property. Large areas of Mongol territory that covered or connected much of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East became bridges between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. Caravans and embassies passing through Mongol lands brought new foods, inventions, and ideas from one center of civilization to others and transmitted them to the nomadic cultures acting as intermediaries. The secure trade routes created wealthy merchants and thriving, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of food and inventions, becoming a major driving force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life. \u2014 Robert Guisepi, 1992 Which of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 13th century?",
