Without informing the neighbor, the wedding organizer went ahead with his plan to enhance the roadbed by having the road paved with asphalt to make it more accessible for car traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that eventually ruined the asphalt surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor began his sand business, the wedding organizer sold his lakeside property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cabin and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus blocking the access to the artist's property.

However, because the father had lost a significant quantity of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor verbally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and requested a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly recorded the order for A-positive blood.

Without informing the telephone company or obtaining a warrant, the police set up a listening device on the public phone.

        "question": "A man and a woman were traveling eastbound along a steep two-lane curving highway. The woman was driving ahead of the man. As the man neared the back of the woman's vehicle, he became restless and attempted to overtake her along a section of the highway marked as a no-passing zone. When the man veered his car into the westbound lane to overtake the woman, he didn't notice another driver, who was coming around a bend in the westbound lane. To avoid a head-on crash with the man, the other driver swerved his car to the shoulder of the road. The other driver, however, was unable to maintain control of his car along the narrow stretch of the shoulder, and it plunged down the steep mountain. The man and the woman both witnessed the other driver's car slide down the hillside. They immediately halted their vehicles and walked over to the edge of the road looking for the car. They saw the other driver's car overturned in a ravine about 200 feet down the mountain. The man and the woman heard the other driver moaning and calling for help. However, the man and the woman did not provide any assistance. They walked back to their cars and drove away. Although the man and the woman passed through a commercial area a short while later, they neither reported the accident nor sought help for the other driver. Hours afterward, the other driver died from injuries sustained in the accident. If the man and the woman are subsequently prosecuted for the other driver's death, the most likely outcome would be that"

        "question": "An investor possessed significant oil and mineral stakes in the Rocky Mountains. In July 1990, the investor acquired ownership of a 100-acre plot situated just outside the city limits in a countryside area. In 1997, the investor decided to sell his extensive ranching and oil stakes in the Rocky Mountains. In July, the investor transferred the tract for a payment of one dollar, receipt of which was confirmed, \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife passes away without offspring, to my chef and her heirs and assigns.\" After taking control of the 100-acre plot, the nephew found substantial oil deposits on the property. He then initiated oil drilling operations and extracted large volumes of oil, which he sold. At no time did he notify the chef of his oil-drilling activities. Months elapsed before the chef discovered that the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. The chef has now filed a legal action for an accounting of the value of the oil extracted and for an injunction against any further oil extraction. If the nephew's wife had passed away without offspring before the commencement of the nephew's oil drilling operations, would this increase the likelihood of the chef's success compared to if the wife were still living?"

Although his previous anti-government protest gatherings attracted fewer than 15 participants, he decided to apply for a permit according to the city regulation. After meeting with the anarchist, the chief of police refused his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would provoke the protestors and pose an immediate threat of violence or serious disturbance. On October 4, the anarchist and his fellow protestors organized their anti-government protest at a municipal park. The rally attracted only about 17 protestors and was conducted peacefully.

The man's and the nephew's lots were in an undeveloped natural condition. The son, however, had resided for 10 years in a house that he had constructed on his property.

Firstly, if challenged by the temporal power, they have asserted and upheld that the temporal power has no authority over them, but, conversely, that the spiritual power is superior to the temporal. Secondly, if it were suggested to admonish them with the Scriptures, they argued that no one may interpret the Scriptures except the Pope. Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they claim that no one may convene a council except the Pope\u2026 \u2026The second barrier is even more unstable and fragile: that they alone claim to be regarded as masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them throughout their life. They assume authority, and deceive us with brazen words, claiming that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, although they cannot support it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, indeed unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Spirit never departs from them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they wish. But were this true, where would be the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and satisfy ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Spirit resides, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such absurdities at Rome and find a following.\" Martin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520 When the author of the passage above discusses the 'second barrier,' to what is he alluding?"

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as massive and as slow to fire as they were, proved beneficial enough in the prolonged sieges that dominated warfare during this era that governments found it adequately worthwhile to finance them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder arms that were both more potent and easier to transport. Conversely, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder arms, with their clumsiness, proved of little value. It therefore focused its efforts on the enhancement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest enemy.

        "question": "This inquiry pertains to the following details. Indeed, the distinctive irritation of the Cawnpore slaughters was this, that the act was committed by a subordinate race \u2014 by black men who dared to spill the blood of their superiors, and that of defenseless ladies and youngsters. Here we had not just a servile rebellion, but we had a conflict of faith, a conflict of race, and a conflict of retribution, of aspiration, of national urgings to cast off the burden of a foreigner, and to restore the complete authority of native leaders, and the complete influence of native faiths. Whatever the reasons for the uprising and the rebellion, it is sufficiently evident that one of the methods by which the leaders, as if by shared instinct, resolved to achieve their goal was, the annihilation of every white man, woman or child who came into their possession. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutiny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be stressed, was a crucial element of the British presence in India. A prevailing power is always uneasy with violence aimed at it. The right to violence is, consequently, universally a privilege that authority holds and refuses to share with those beneath it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had carefully constructed a monopoly of violence. The uprising of 1857 disrupted that monopoly by equating an official, foreign violence with a native violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predetermined by birth and by the color of their skin. This was the condition of their dominance, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were organized hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a 'humanness'; by treating them and perceiving them as animals.
