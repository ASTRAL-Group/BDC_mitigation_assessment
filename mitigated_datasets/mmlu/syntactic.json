To facilitate access to the cottage, which is situated on a knoll above the lake, an agreement was entered into by the wedding planner with a neighbor, an adjoining landowner. The agreement, made in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land that is 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the wedding planner went ahead with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted, making it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor began a sand business, which necessitated heavy hauling and subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after starting his sand business, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing access to the artist's property shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property. The interest acquired by the wedding planner in the access road may best be described as"

A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, because the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor instructed orally a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father.

        "question": "Driving eastbound along a steep two-lane winding highway were a man and a woman. In front of the man, the woman was driving. As the man approached the rear of the woman's car, he became impatient, trying to pass her on a section of the highway marked as a no-passing zone. When the man swerved his car into the westbound lane to pass the woman, he failed to see another driver rounding a curve in the westbound lane. To avoid a head-on collision with the man, the other driver swerved his car to the shoulder of the roadway. However, the other driver was unable to control his car along the narrow strip of the shoulder, and it fell down the steep mountain. Both the man and the woman saw the other driver's car slide down the hillside. They stopped their vehicles immediately and walked over to the edge of the roadway to look for the car. They saw the other driver's car overturned in a gully about 200 feet down the mountain. The man and the woman heard the other driver moaning and calling for help. However, they failed to provide any assistance, walking back to their cars and driving off. Although the man and the woman passed through a business area a short while later, they neither reported the accident nor sought aid for the other driver. Hours later, the other driver died from injuries suffered in the accident. If the man and the woman are subsequently prosecuted for the other driver's death, the most likely outcome would be that"

        "question": "Substantial oil and mineral interests in the Rocky Mountains were owned by an investor. In July 1990, title to a 100-acre tract located just outside the city limits in a rural area was acquired by the investor. The investor decided in 1997 to sell his vast ranching and oil interests in the Rocky Mountains. The tract was conveyed by the investor in July for the consideration of one dollar, the receipt of which was acknowledged, 'to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns.' After taking possession of the 100-acre tract, considerable oil reserves on the property were discovered by the nephew. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did notice of his oil-drilling activities get given to the chef by him. Months passed before the chef learned the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. An action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal has now been brought by the chef. Would the likelihood of the chef's success improve if the nephew's wife died without issue before the beginning of the nephew's oil drilling operations, compared to if the wife were still alive?"

He decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city ordinance, even though his previous antigovernment protest rallies attracted fewer than 15 demonstrators. The chief of police denied his permit application after meeting with the anarchist because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On October 4, the anarchist and his fellow demonstrators staged their antigovernment protest at a city park. Only about 17 protestors were attracted to the rally, and it was conducted peacefully. As the anarchist was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators, charging them with violating the city ordinance. In a subsequent action by the anarchist in state court challenging the constitutionality of Sections 1 and 2 of the city ordinance, the court will most likely rule these sections."

        "question": "The question pertains to the following details. \"The Romanists have skillfully constructed three walls around themselves, which have thus far shielded them, preventing anyone from reforming them, leading to a severe downfall of all Christendom. Firstly, when confronted by the temporal power, they have claimed and upheld that the temporal power holds no authority over them, asserting instead that the spiritual power surpasses the temporal. Secondly, if it was suggested to correct them with the Scriptures, they refuted that no one could interpret the Scriptures except the Pope. Thirdly, if threatened by a council, they pretended that only the Pope may convene a council\u2026 The second wall is even more fragile and feeble: they alone pretend to be regarded as masters of the Scriptures; despite learning nothing of them throughout their lives. They assume authority, juggling before us with brazen words, stating that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether evil or good, although they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, even unnatural, laws; however, we need not discuss these now. For while they imagine that the Holy Ghost never leaves them, regardless of how unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they desire. But if this were true, what would be the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them and be satisfied with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost resides, but who can only dwell in pious souls. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such absurdities at Rome and found supporters.\" Martin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520 When the passage's author refers to the \"second wall,\" what is he discussing?"

The victorious legions, who acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries in distant wars, first oppressed the republic's freedom and then violated the majesty of the purple.

        "question": "This question pertains to the following information: \"In recent years, the spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside, with new rich peasants emerging everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. Conversely, many poor peasants are still living in poverty due to a lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency remains unchecked, polarization in the countryside will inevitably worsen day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Additionally, the well-to-do middle peasants who are moving in the capitalist direction will not be pleased with us, as we will never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Clearly not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. That means bringing about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means carrying out co-operation and eliminating the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could traverse the well-policed Mongol domains without fearing for their lives or property. The expansive Mongol territory that encompassed or linked most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East acted as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. Caravans and embassies crossing the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples serving as intermediaries. Secure trade routes led to prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities.

However, such neglect could result from various other reasons, and it is likely that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur, there were many chiefs and tribes in positions that constitutional lawyers would consider anomalous, at times paying the required revenue, at times openly rebelling, and at times enjoying de facto independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active coercion measures.'

In the 1200s through the 1400s in Western Europe, despite being heavy and slow to fire, early cannons proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period. This utility led governments to find it sufficiently worthwhile to invest in them and in experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, in China, especially after the mid-1300s, early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility against the highly mobile steppe nomads who mainly threatened the country.

They are not compensated for the labor involved in traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. Under the guise of mining tasks, the Indians are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and transporting goods; they are dispatched to the plains, leading to the deaths of many Indians. The Indians' labor goes unpaid, and their work remains concealed. [The mine owners] retain Indian cooking women in their homes, using cooking as a pretext for keeping concubines\u2026. They force the Indians to accept corn, meat, or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, deducting the cost from their labor and workdays. Consequently, the Indians end up impoverished and heavily in debt, with no means to pay their tribute.

The peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was, in fact, that the deed was executed by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Not only did we have a servile war here, but also a war of religion, a war of race, a war of revenge, a war of hope, and a war prompted by national aspirations to shake off the yoke of a stranger and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt were, it is clear enough that one of the methods by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, decided to achieve their goal was the destruction of every white man, woman, or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutiny Diary, 1860. It must be emphasized that violence was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. Therefore, the right to violence is everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence with an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the color of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a 'humanness'; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals. Rudrangshu Mukherjee, 'The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,' 1990. From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore."

One town is occupied by Muslims, who have twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, as well as jurists and scholars. Wells with sweet water, from which they drink and use to grow vegetables, are found in the surrounding areas. The king's interpreters, the official responsible for his treasury, and most of his ministers are Muslims. Sewn clothes may be worn only by royalty. Depending on their means, all other people wear robes made of cotton, silk, or brocade. Necklaces around his neck and bracelets on his forearms are worn by the king, who adorns himself like a woman. He sits in a domed pavilion, around which ten horses stand. When people who share the king's religion approach him, they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, as this is their way of greeting him. Muslims, however, greet him by clapping their hands. The people's religion is paganism and idol worship. On every donkey-load of salt brought into the country, their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. The king's due from a load of copper is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods, it is ten mithqals. The king reserves the nuggets found in all the mines in his country, leaving only gold dust for the people. Without this measure, people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country is another called Malal, whose king was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people in his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then, their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani."

It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from only one side; it has no crops, trees, or water, but reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their drinking-water supply until they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. The port of the Indians, it is, and large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India] come to it. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is the sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry among them. In spite of that, they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\" Ibn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.

        "question": "The following information is what this question refers to. While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that jihad was a defensive war, most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and that ruler would be better dead than alive if he does not do so and makes peace with the infidel, for he would be corrupting the world. Robert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995 It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories. Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185 These two passages are best understood in the context of which of the following?"
