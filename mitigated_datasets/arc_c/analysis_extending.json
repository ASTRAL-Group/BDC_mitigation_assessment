            "A. Domestic cats exhibit heightened territorial aggression compared to wild felines as a primary response to environmental changes, mainly due to their limited roaming space.",
            "B. Domestic cats show similar hunting instincts as wild felines but have adapted to a more opportunistic feeding strategy due to consistent food availability.",
            "C. Domestic cats rely heavily on vocal communication in response to stimuli, whereas wild felines primarily use scent marking and visual signals.",
            "D. Domestic cats display a greater degree of nocturnal activity compared to wild felines as a response to human activity during the day."

        "question": "Analyze the process of dissolving a sugar cube in water. What are the factors that influence the dissolution rate, and how do these factors interact with each other to affect the overall process?",
        "choices": [
            "A. The dissolution rate is solely determined by the surface area of the sugar cube, with no influence from water temperature or stirring.",
            "B. The dissolution rate is influenced by the temperature of the water, which increases the kinetic energy of molecules, and by stirring, which enhances the interaction between water and sugar molecules.",
            "C. The dissolution rate is only affected by the amount of sugar in the cube, regardless of changes in water temperature or the presence of stirring.",
            "D. The dissolution rate is primarily affected by the initial concentration of sugar in the water, with temperature and stirring having negligible effects."

        "question": "Analyze the process of a subduction zone formation and its associated geological features. How does this process contribute to the occurrence of volcanic activity and the formation of mountain ranges, and what are the key interactions involved between the oceanic and continental crusts?",
        "choices": [
            "A. Subduction zones contribute to volcanic activity by melting the subducting oceanic crust, which rises to form volcanic arcs, while the pressure from the collision does not affect mountain formation.",
            "B. Subduction zones lead to the formation of volcanic arcs and mountain ranges through the melting of the subducting oceanic crust and the compression of the continental crust, resulting in magma generation and crustal deformation.",
            "C. Volcanic activity at subduction zones is primarily due to the subduction of the continental crust beneath the oceanic crust, creating magma through mantle convection, while mountain formation is unrelated.",
            "D. The interaction between oceanic and continental crusts at subduction zones does not typically lead to volcanic activity, but solely causes the formation of deep oceanic trenches and minor crustal uplift."

        "question": "Analyze the energy transformation and force interactions when a ball is thrown downward onto a concrete floor and bounces back up. How do these transformations and interactions contribute to the ball's ability to bounce?",
        "choices": [
            "A. The gravitational potential energy of the ball is converted into kinetic energy during the fall, and the concrete floor exerts an upward normal force that transforms kinetic energy back into potential energy, allowing the ball to bounce.",
            "B. The ball's kinetic energy is absorbed entirely by the concrete floor, which then releases stored potential energy in the form of an upward force, causing the ball to bounce.",
            "C. The ball compresses upon impact, storing elastic potential energy, which is released as kinetic energy when the ball returns to its original shape, aided by the upward normal force from the floor.",
            "D. The impact generates heat energy, which creates an upward buoyant force due to air pressure differences, allowing the ball to bounce."
